<p>Sherlock Season 4 dropped its finale on January 15, 2017. Since then, the series viewers are wondering if they'd ever get a Season 5. Here's all we know about renewal, cast, and plot of Sherlock Season 5.</p>
Sherlock has been praised for the quality of its writing, acting, and direction. It has been nominated for numerous awards including Emmys, BAFTAs and Golden Globe. The show also won several awards across a variety of categories.
Much of the show's popularity is because of the natural acting performances of Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes and Martin Freeman as Doctor John Watson. While there is no confirmation on the making of the fifth run, several times viewers have been given many indications that Sherlock Season 5 could happen.
